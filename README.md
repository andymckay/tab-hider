The API this extension uses is experimental. To use this extension, you must go to *about:config* and set *extensions.webextensions.tabhide.enabled* to *true*.

It provides a very simple tab hiding functionality to demonstrate the tab.hide and show APIs.

Functionality:

* Right click on a tab and click "Hide this tab" to hide a tab.
* Click on the menu button (the browserAction) to get a list of all the hidden tabs.
* Click on the menu button to turn on an automatic "sweeper" which will hide tabs that haven't been accessed.

Don't expect this extension to do a whole lot more.
