The API this extension uses is experimental. To use this extension, you must go to *about:config* and set *extensions.webextensions.tabhide.enabled* to *true*.

It provides a very simple tab hiding functionality to demonstrate the tab.hide and show APIs.

Don't expect this extension to do a whole lot more.
